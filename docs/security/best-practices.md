# Security Best Practices for CSV to Providers JSON Converter

## Overview

This document outlines the security best practices implemented in the CSV to Providers JSON converter (`csv-to-providers-secure-final.js`). The converter processes CSV files containing API provider configurations and generates a secure JSON output while protecting sensitive information.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. API Key Masking

**Feature**: All API keys in the output JSON are masked to prevent accidental exposure.

**Implementation**:
- Keys are replaced with a pattern like `sk-t***7890` or `D6iv***1F7r`
- Only the first 4 characters and last 4 characters are preserved
- The middle portion is replaced with asterisks

**Example**:
```javascript
// Input
"api_key": "sk-test1234567890"

// Output
"api_key": "sk-t***7890"
```

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization

**Feature**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized before processing.

**Implementation**:
- URL validation ensures only valid HTTP/HTTPS URLs are accepted
- Input sanitization removes potentially dangerous characters
- Special field-specific sanitization for URLs, names, and API keys

**Example**:
```javascript
// Input
"https://example.com/api?param=<script>alert(1)</script>"

// Sanitized Output
"https://example.com/api?param=scriptalert(1)/script"
```

### 3. Output Sanitization

**Feature**: The final JSON output is sanitized to remove any sensitive data.

**Implementation**:
- Recursive sanitization of all nested objects
- Removal of control characters and special separators
- Field-specific sanitization based on field names

### 4. Error Message Sanitization

**Feature**: Error messages are sanitized to prevent information leakage.

**Implementation**:
- Stack traces and internal details are removed
- Error messages are replaced with generic messages
- Sensitive data in error messages is masked

**Example**:
```javascript
// Original Error
"Database connection failed: user=\"admin\" password=\"secret123\""

// Sanitized Error
"{ message: 'Operation failed', code: 'UNKNOWN_ERROR' }"
```

### 5. Secure Logging Practices

**Feature**: All logging is done with security in mind.

**Implementation**:
- No sensitive data is logged in plain text
- API keys are masked in log messages
- Error details are sanitized before logging

### 6. Environment Variable Security

**Feature**: Secure handling of environment variables.

**Implementation**:
- Environment variables are accessed through secure wrappers
- Sensitive environment variables are automatically masked
- No plain text storage of sensitive data

### 7. Rate Limit and Cost Information Parsing

**Feature**: Secure parsing of rate limit and cost information.

**Implementation**:
- Structured parsing of free/paid model information
- No exposure of sensitive pricing details
- Proper categorization of model costs

## Usage Guidelines

### Basic Usage

```javascript
const { generateProvidersJSON } = require('./csv-to-providers-secure-final.js');

// Generate providers.json from CSV
await generateProvidersCSV('./providers.csv', './providers.json');
```

### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for enhanced security:

```bash
# HuggingFace API Key (optional, for enhanced model information)
export HF_API_KEY="your-hf-api-key"

# OpenAI API Key (for testing/demo purposes)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-test-key"
```

### CSV Format Requirements

Your CSV should include these required fields:
- `Name` or `Provider`: Provider name
- `Base_URL`: Base API URL
- `Model(s)`: Model identifier(s)

Optional fields:
- `APIKey` or `ApiKey`: API key
- `Priority`: Priority number (default: 99)
- `TokenMultiplier`: Token multiplier (default: 1.0)
- `Rate Limit/Cost Info`: Rate limit and cost information

## Security Considerations

### 1. Input Validation

- Always validate CSV files before processing
- Check for proper field formats and required fields
- Reject malformed or suspicious input

### 2. Output Protection

- Never commit the generated JSON to version control
- Restrict file permissions on the output file
- Consider encrypting sensitive output files

### 3. API Key Management

- Use environment variables for API keys when possible
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use the least privilege principle for API keys

### 4. Error Handling

- Implement proper error handling in your application
- Log errors securely without exposing sensitive information
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### 5. File Permissions

- Ensure proper file permissions on input and output files
- Restrict access to sensitive configuration files
- Use appropriate user accounts for running the converter

## Testing Security Measures

### Running Security Tests

```bash
# Test basic security functions
node -e "
const { sanitizeInput, validateURL, maskApiKey } = require('./csv-to-providers-secure-final.js');
console.log('URL Validation:', validateURL('https://api.example.com'));
console.log('Input Sanitization:', sanitizeInput('<script>alert(1)</script>', 'name'));
console.log('API Key Masking:', maskApiKey('sk-test1234567890'));
"
```

### Verifying API Key Masking

Check the generated JSON to ensure API keys are properly masked:

```bash
grep -n "api_key" providers.json | head -5
# Should show masked keys like:
# "api_key": "sk-t***7890",
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Security Issues

1. **API Keys Not Masked**
   - Ensure `MASK_API_KEYS` is set to `true`
   - Check that the `api_key` field exists in your CSV

2. **Input Validation Errors**
   - Verify all URLs use proper HTTP/HTTPS schemes
   - Check for special characters in field values
   - Ensure required fields are present

3. **Error Message Exposure**
   - Verify error sanitization is working
   - Check console output for sensitive information

### Debug Mode

For debugging, you can temporarily disable some security features:

```javascript
// Set to false to disable API key masking
const MASK_API_KEYS = false;

// Set to false to disable input sanitization
const SANITIZE_INPUT = false;
```

**Warning**: Only do this in development environments. Never disable security features in production.

## Conclusion

The CSV to Providers JSON converter includes comprehensive security measures to protect sensitive information. By following these best practices, you can ensure the security and integrity of your API provider configurations.

Remember:
- Always validate input data
- Mask sensitive information in output
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Regularly review and update security measures
