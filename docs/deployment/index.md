# Deployment Guides

This directory contains platform-specific deployment guides for the AI API Proxy Server. Choose the deployment method that best fits your infrastructure and requirements.

## Available Deployment Methods

### [Docker Deployment](./docker.md)
- **Best for**: Containerized environments, consistent deployments, and scalability
- **Requirements**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **Features**: Multi-stage builds, health checks, and volume management

### [Cloud Services](./cloud-services.md)
- **Best for**: Managed cloud platforms with automatic scaling and monitoring
- **Platforms**: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Heroku
- **Features**: Auto-scaling, load balancing, managed SSL, and monitoring

### [Traditional Server](./traditional-server.md)
- **Best for**: Bare metal servers, VPS, or dedicated servers
- **Platforms**: Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, etc.
- **Features**: Full control, custom configurations, and performance optimization

### [Kubernetes](./kubernetes.md)
- **Best for**: Large-scale deployments, orchestration, and high availability
- **Requirements**: Kubernetes cluster and Helm
- **Features**: Auto-scaling, rolling updates, and service mesh integration

### [Serverless](./serverless.md)
- **Best for**: Event-driven architectures and cost-effective scaling
- **Platforms**: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Vercel
- **Features**: Pay-per-use, automatic scaling, and no server management

## Choosing the Right Deployment Method

| Deployment Method | Complexity | Scalability | Cost Control | Management Overhead | Best For |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| Docker | Medium | High | Medium | Low | Development, staging, production |
| Cloud Services | Low | High | High | Low | Quick start, managed infrastructure |
| Traditional Server | High | Medium | Low | High | Full control, custom requirements |
| Kubernetes | High | Very High | Medium | High | Enterprise, large-scale deployments |
| Serverless | Low | High | Variable | Very Low | Event-driven, variable workloads |

## Quick Start Recommendations

### For Beginners
- **Cloud Services**: Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- **Docker**: Docker Compose for local development and simple deployments

### For Developers
- **Docker**: Docker Compose with development environment
- **Traditional Server**: Ubuntu with PM2 process management

### For Production
- **Cloud Services**: AWS ECS or Google Cloud Run
- **Kubernetes**: For high availability and auto-scaling
- **Traditional Server**: Ubuntu with Nginx reverse proxy and PM2

## Common Deployment Patterns

### 1. Load Balanced Setup
```
Load Balancer → Multiple Proxy Instances → AI Providers
```

### 2. Multi-Region Deployment
```
Region 1 → Proxy Instance 1 → AI Providers
Region 2 → Proxy Instance 2 → AI Providers
```

### 3. Hybrid Cloud
```
On-Premises → Private Cloud → Public Cloud → AI Providers
```
